<h1>About Civic Pantry Lab and our verification-first approach</h1>
</header>

<section id="mission">
<h2>Our mission for US food access navigation</h2>
<p>Civic Pantry Lab exists to help US households navigate food assistance resources with confidence and clarity. We recognize that finding a <strong>food pantry finder</strong> tool is only the first step—verifying listings, understanding eligibility requirements, and preparing for visits requires additional guidance that many directories do not provide.</p>
<p>Our mission centers on responsible resource navigation. We do not maintain real-time pantry databases or collect personal information. Instead, we provide structured guidance that empowers readers to verify information independently, plan visits effectively, and access food assistance without unnecessary barriers or wasted trips.</p>
<p>We believe that accurate, accessible information reduces stress for households facing food insecurity. By explaining verification methods, documenting common practices, and linking to authoritative sources, we help readers become informed advocates for their own needs. Our expert authoritative tone reflects our commitment to precision and reliability.</p>
<p>Explore our <a href="/">home guide</a> for comprehensive food pantry finder methods, or visit our <a href="/faq.html">FAQ</a> for answers to common questions about eligibility, documents, and visit planning. These resources complement each other to provide thorough coverage of food access navigation in the United States.</p>

<section id="standards">
<h2>Sourcing and verification standards</h2>
<p>Civic Pantry Lab prioritizes official and established sources when developing content. We reference <strong>.gov websites</strong> for federal program information, including the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/" rel="noopener">USDA Food and Nutrition Service</a> for SNAP, WIC, and commodity program details. Government sources provide authoritative program descriptions, eligibility guidelines, and state-level application pathways.</p>
<p>We rely on <strong>.org networks</strong> with established track records in food assistance, particularly Feeding America and its member food banks. These organizations maintain updated locator tools and coordinate thousands of partner pantries nationwide. Regional food banks often provide more current local information than national directories alone.</p>
<p>For general nutrition guidance and federal resource aggregation, we reference <a href="https://www.nutrition.gov/" rel="noopener">Nutrition.gov</a>, a USDA-maintained hub connecting users to food assistance programs, dietary guidance, and related resources. Cross-referencing multiple official sources helps us identify discrepancies and maintain accuracy.</p>
<p>We acknowledge inherent limitations in any static guide. Pantry hours, requirements, and service areas change frequently based on funding, staffing, supply availability, and local conditions. Our content provides frameworks for verification rather than real-time data. We consistently encourage readers to call ahead and confirm details directly with pantries they plan to visit.</p>
<p>We avoid relying on unverified social media posts, user-generated content without editorial oversight, or sources that may contain outdated information. When we identify conflicting information across sources, we note the variability and recommend direct verification.</p>
</section>

<section id="editorial">
<h2>Editorial policy and updates</h2>
<p>Civic Pantry Lab reviews and updates content on a regular basis to maintain accuracy and relevance. Our editorial process includes cross-checking guidance against current official sources, revising content when programs or practices change, and removing or correcting outdated information.</p>
<p>We welcome reader feedback and corrections. If you identify inaccurate information, broken links, or outdated guidance, please contact us at <a href="mailto:corrections@example.com">corrections@example.com</a>. We review all submissions and prioritize corrections that affect reader safety or access to resources.</p>
<p>Our update cadence balances thoroughness with practicality. Major program changes (such as SNAP policy updates or new federal initiatives) prompt immediate review. Routine content audits occur quarterly to verify link functionality and source currency. We date-stamp significant revisions to help readers assess information freshness.</p>
<p>Editorial independence guides our work. We do not accept payment for favorable coverage, and we do not allow commercial interests to influence our recommendations. Our goal is serving readers who need reliable food access guidance, not promoting specific organizations or products.</p>

<h2>Table: what we publish vs. what we avoid</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A note on pantry capacity:</strong> Food pantries operate with limited staff, volunteers, and supplies. When calling to verify information, please be concise and respectful. Prepare your questions in advance, and thank staff for their time. Your courtesy helps pantries serve more households effectively.</p>

<section id="contact">
<h2>Contact and accessibility</h2>
<p>We welcome questions, feedback, and suggestions for improving Civic Pantry Lab resources. Contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@example.com">hello@example.com</a> for general inquiries or <a href="mailto:corrections@example.com">corrections@example.com</a> to report inaccuracies.</p>
<h3>Accessibility commitment</h3>
<p>Civic Pantry Lab is committed to making our content accessible to all users. We design with accessibility in mind, including semantic HTML structure, sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility. We use clear heading hierarchies, descriptive link text, and table captions to support assistive technologies.</p>
<p>If you encounter accessibility barriers on our site, please contact us with details about the issue and your preferred format. We will work to address barriers and improve our accessibility practices.</p>
<h3>For urgent food needs</h3>
<p>If you need food assistance today, please call <strong>211</strong> for immediate referrals to local resources. Civic Pantry Lab provides planning guidance but cannot connect you directly with food distribution. The 211 service operates 24/7 in most areas and can identify pantries, meal programs, and emergency resources available now.</p>
<p>For ongoing support, explore SNAP and WIC applications through your state benefits portal. These programs provide monthly assistance that supplements emergency food resources. Our <a href="/">home guide</a> and <a href="/faq.html">FAQ</a> provide additional context for navigating these options.</p>
